In what ways does GitHub help scientists follow the best practices for scientific computing?

Github is a useful tool in scientific computing best practices for a variety of reasons. Primarily, it allows collaboration on projects.
This collaborative element is useful in other best practices as it encourages careful documentation and clear coding. Since it makes code
written by other users available, it can facilitate use of more sophisticated code by users with less experience. Fially, Github allows
users to save incremental changes, allowing them to return to previous versions if a problem arises.
